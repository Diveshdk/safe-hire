# Quick Demo Setup - Manual Method

Since email confirmation can be tricky, here's the manual way to create a demo institution:

## Method 1: Use Your Email

1. **Sign up normally** at `/sign-up`
2. **Select "Institution/Organization"**
3. **Enter your real email** (so you can confirm it)
4. **Use these details:**
   - Institution Name: `MIT Demo University`
   - Institution Type: `University`
5. **Confirm your email** from your inbox
6. **Login and click "Create Demo Certificates"** on the dashboard

## Method 2: Pre-made NFT Codes (No Email Needed)

If you want to test immediately without creating an institution account, you can use these NFT codes in any job seeker account:

### Demo NFT Codes for Testing:
```
John Doe → MIT2024CS001
Jane Smith → MIT2024DS002  
Alice Johnson → MIT2024ML003
Bob Wilson → MIT2024AI004
Charlie Brown → MIT2024IC005
Diana Prince → MIT2024PHD006
```

### How to Test:
1. Create a **Job Seeker** account with your email
2. Go to **Academic Verification** form
3. Enter any recipient name above (exact spelling!)
4. Enter the corresponding NFT code
5. Should get **instant verification** ✅

### Manual Database Insert:
If you want the institution account without email confirmation, I can create a SQL script that directly inserts the demo data into your database.

Would you like me to create the SQL script instead?
